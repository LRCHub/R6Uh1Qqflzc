This is an admission and our mission is to bring down the walls
It's our mission, not fall to submission
Life is an addiction with conviction, you're a Hollywood star
My addiction to feed my conviction
Light up the fire, I bring you back to life
Taking us higher like it's the Fourth of July
That's right, come on
We can make it hot, hot, bring it on the rocks
'Round, 'round, down right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot, drop it like it's hot
So swing another round, right, 'cause we will never stop
Speeding up my future, I'm unbound as I restring my guitar
I've got no regrets along the path to be a Hollywood star
A Hollywood's sunset, I'm bound to the boulevard
Trapped in a wire bringing me back to life
Get ready to fight, we ignite like the Fourth of July
That's right, come on
We can make it hot, hot, bring it on the rocks
'Round, 'round, down right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot, drop it like it's hot
So swing another round, right, 'cause we will never stop
Bring it on the rocks
Bring it on the rocks
A lonesome desire, a freak on a ward
I'm torn into pieces as I restring my guitar
So this is my future; my Hollywood scars
Got shattered into nothing; a self-proclaimed superstar
We can make it hot, hot, bring it on the rocks
'Round, 'round, down right until you wanna drop
We can make it hot, hot, bring it on the rocks
'Round, 'round, down right until you wanna drop
Acting like a hotshot, drop it like it's hot
So swing another round, right, 'cause we will never stop
